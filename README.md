# nim-brokers

Type-safe, thread-local, decoupled messaging patterns for Nim, built on top of [chronos](https://github.com/status-im/nim-chronos) and [results](https://github.com/status-im/nim-results).

nim-brokers provides three compile-time macro-generated broker patterns that enable event-driven and request-response communication between modules without direct dependencies.

## Installation

```
nimble install brokers
```

Or add to your `.nimble` file:

```nim
requires "brokers >= 0.1.0"
```

## Broker Types

### EventBroker

Reactive pub/sub: many emitters → many listeners. Listeners are async procs; events are dispatched via `asyncSpawn` (fire-and-forget).

```nim
import brokers/event_broker

EventBroker:
  type GreetingEvent = object
    text*: string

# Register a listener (returns a handle for later removal)
let handle = GreetingEvent.listen(
  proc(evt: GreetingEvent): Future[void] {.async: (raises: []).} =
    echo evt.text
)

# Emit by value
GreetingEvent.emit(GreetingEvent(text: "hello"))

# Emit by fields (inline object types only)
GreetingEvent.emit(text = "hello")

# Remove a single listener
GreetingEvent.dropListener(handle.get())

# Remove all listeners
GreetingEvent.dropAllListeners()
```

### RequestBroker

Single-provider request/response. One provider registers; callers make typed requests. Supports both **async** (default) and **sync** modes.

```nim
import brokers/request_broker

# Async mode (default)
RequestBroker:
  type Greeting = object
    text*: string

  proc signature*(): Future[Result[Greeting, string]] {.async.}
  proc signature*(lang: string): Future[Result[Greeting, string]] {.async.}

Greeting.setProvider(
  proc(): Future[Result[Greeting, string]] {.async.} =
    ok(Greeting(text: "hello"))
)

let res = await Greeting.request()
assert res.isOk()
Greeting.clearProvider()
```

```nim
# Sync mode
RequestBroker(sync):
  type Config = object
    value*: string

  proc signature*(): Result[Config, string]

Config.setProvider(
  proc(): Result[Config, string] =
    ok(Config(value: "default"))
)

let res = Config.request()  # no await needed
Config.clearProvider()
```

If no `signature` proc is declared, a zero-argument form is generated automatically.

### MultiRequestBroker

Multi-provider fan-out request/response (async only). Multiple providers register; `request()` calls all of them and aggregates the results. The request fails if any provider fails.

```nim
import brokers/multi_request_broker

MultiRequestBroker:
  type Info = object
    label*: string

  proc signature*(): Future[Result[Info, string]] {.async.}

discard Info.setProvider(
  proc(): Future[Result[Info, string]] {.async.} =
    ok(Info(label: "from-module-a"))
)

discard Info.setProvider(
  proc(): Future[Result[Info, string]] {.async.} =
    ok(Info(label: "from-module-b"))
)

let responses = await Info.request()  # Result[seq[Info], string]
assert responses.get().len == 2

# Remove a specific provider by handle
let handle = Info.setProvider(myHandler)
Info.removeProvider(handle.get())

# Remove all providers
Info.clearProviders()
```

### RequestBroker (multi-thread)

Cross-thread request/response. The provider runs on the thread that called `setProvider`; requests from **any** thread in the process are routed to it via async channels. Same-thread requests bypass channels entirely for near-zero overhead.

```nim
import std/atomics, std/threads
import chronos
import brokers/request_broker

RequestBroker(mt):
  type Weather = object
    city*: string
    tempC*: float

  proc signature*(city: string): Future[Result[Weather, string]] {.async.}

var done: Atomic[bool]

proc worker() {.thread.} =
  let res = waitFor Weather.request("Berlin")
  doAssert res.isOk()
  done.store(true)

# ── Provider thread (main) ──────────────────────────
proc main() {.async.} =
  initAtomic(done, false)

  doAssert Weather.setProvider(
    proc(city: string): Future[Result[Weather, string]] {.async.} =
      ok(Weather(city: city, tempC: 21.5))
  ).isOk()

  var t: Thread[void]
  t.createThread(worker)
  while not done.load():
    await sleepAsync(chronos.milliseconds(1))
  t.joinThread()
  Weather.clearProvider()

waitFor main()
```

Compile with `--threads:on` (and `--mm:orc` or `--mm:refc`).

**When to choose multi-thread mode:**

- Your provider lives on a dedicated thread (e.g. main/UI loop) and workers need to query it.
- You want a typed, decoupled interface across thread boundaries without manual channel wiring.
- You need multiple independent contexts (`BrokerContext`) served by different threads.

**Cross-thread request timeout:**

Cross-thread requests have a configurable timeout (default: 5 seconds). If the provider thread is unresponsive, `request()` returns `err` instead of hanging. Same-thread requests are unaffected.

```nim
Weather.setRequestTimeout(chronos.seconds(2))  # shorten timeout
echo Weather.requestTimeout()                   # 2 seconds
```

**Performance considerations:**

- **Same-thread path** adds only a mutex + threadvar scan (~25 µs debug, sub-microsecond release).
- **Cross-thread path** allocates a one-shot response channel per request (~187 µs debug / ~2-5 µs release with ORC). `--mm:refc` is ~2-3x slower due to deep-copy semantics on `sendSync`.
- The provider serves requests sequentially on its event loop; throughput is bounded by handler execution time.
- For high-throughput scenarios (>10K req/s), consider batching at the application level or using `--mm:orc`.

See [Multi-Thread RequestBroker](doc/MultiThread_RequestBroker.md) for architecture diagrams, call sequences, and memory layout details. Run `nimble perftest` for benchmarks.

### EventBroker (multi-thread)

Cross-thread pub/sub (fire-and-forget). Listeners can be registered on **any** thread; events emitted from **any** thread are broadcast to all registered listeners. Same-thread delivery uses `asyncSpawn` (no channel); cross-thread delivery uses `AsyncChannel` per listener-thread.

```nim
import brokers/event_broker
import std/atomics

EventBroker(mt):
  type Alert = object
    level*: int
    message*: string

var doneFlag {.global.}: Atomic[bool]

proc worker() {.thread.} =
  waitFor Alert.emit(Alert(level: 1, message: "from worker"))
  doneFlag.store(true, moRelaxed)

# ── Listener on main thread ────────────────────────────
proc main() {.async.} =
  let handle = Alert.listen(
    proc(evt: Alert): Future[void] {.async: (raises: []).} =
      echo "Alert [", evt.level, "]: ", evt.message
  )
  doAssert handle.isOk()

  var t: Thread[void]
  t.createThread(worker)
  while not doneFlag.load(moRelaxed):
    await sleepAsync(chronos.milliseconds(1))
  t.joinThread()
  Alert.dropAllListeners()

waitFor main()
```

Compile with `--threads:on` (and `--mm:orc` or `--mm:refc`).

**Key differences from single-thread EventBroker:**

- `emit()` is **async** — use `await` in async contexts or `waitFor` from `{.thread.}` procs.
- `dropListener` must be called from the **registering thread** (enforced at runtime).
- `dropAllListeners` can be called from **any thread** — sends shutdown to all listener threads and drains in-flight listener tasks before cleanup.

**Performance considerations:**

- **Same-thread path** bypasses channels entirely — events dispatch directly via `asyncSpawn`.
- **Cross-thread path** uses `sendSync` to each listener thread's channel (~20-160 µs debug, sub-millisecond release).
- Broadcast fan-out: one channel per (BrokerContext, listener-thread) pair.
- For high-throughput scenarios, prefer `--mm:orc` and `-d:release`.

See [Multi-Thread EventBroker](doc/MultiThread_EventBroker.md) for architecture diagrams and memory layout details. Run `nimble perftest` for benchmarks.

## BrokerContext

All three brokers support scoped instances via `BrokerContext`. This is useful when multiple independent components on the same thread each need their own broker state (e.g. separate listener/provider sets).

```nim
import brokers/broker_context
import brokers/event_broker

EventBroker:
  type MyEvent = object
    value*: int

let ctxA = NewBrokerContext()
let ctxB = NewBrokerContext()

# Listeners registered under different contexts are isolated
discard MyEvent.listen(ctxA, proc(evt: MyEvent): Future[void] {.async: (raises: []).} =
  echo "A: ", evt.value
)
discard MyEvent.listen(ctxB, proc(evt: MyEvent): Future[void] {.async: (raises: []).} =
  echo "B: ", evt.value
)

MyEvent.emit(ctxA, MyEvent(value: 1))  # only context A listener fires
MyEvent.emit(ctxB, MyEvent(value: 2))  # only context B listener fires

MyEvent.dropAllListeners(ctxA)
MyEvent.dropAllListeners(ctxB)
```

When no `BrokerContext` argument is passed, the `DefaultBrokerContext` is used.

A global context lock is available via `lockGlobalBrokerContext` for serialized cross-module coordination within `chronos` async procs.

## Non-Object Types

All three brokers support native types, aliases, and externally-defined types. These are automatically wrapped in `distinct` to prevent overload ambiguity. If the type is already `distinct`, it is preserved as-is.

```nim
RequestBroker(sync):
  type Counter = int  # exported as `distinct int`

Counter.setProvider(proc(): Result[Counter, string] = ok(Counter(42)))
let val = int(Counter.request().get())  # unwrap with cast
```
